### Incident Management

Examples of good/bad incident management procedures:
Bad: "in case of DB being dropped call Bob" sticky
Why: Do we know Bob number? Do we know his private mobile in case his company phone runs out of battery? Do we know who we should get in touch with if Bob gets run over by a bus in a second Incident arrises?

Good: "in case of DB being dropped call Bob at ABC work phone, if he does not answer call XYZ mobile, in case Bob is unavailable call Jay" sticky
Why: All the information is present and is easy to understand, with no space for interpretation.

In general, good incident response procedures are prepared with an assumption they are going to be used by first-time junior incident responder, in the middle of the night with no immediate help unavailable.
